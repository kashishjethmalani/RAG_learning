The problem is to decide if there is a set S of k vertices of G for which, when removing\\nthe vertices of S from G (and all edges incident with them) the resulting graph is acyclic.

Similar to the\\nEdit Distance problem, the allowed edits are to add a digit, remove a digit, or change the\\nvalue of a digit. However, the cost of an edit depends on the value(s) of the digit(s) involved in\\nthe edit. For example, adding or removing digit x has a cost equal to x, while changing digit x\\nto digit y incurs a cost equal to |x −y|.

Introduction \\n \\nBughound is a web-based bug tracking system designed to record, update, search, and \\nmanage bug reports across software projects. It also manages related data including \\nPrograms, Employees, and Functional Areas. The application enables users to create new \\nbugs, update existing bugs, search bug records, and maintain database tables. \\nThis report provides a complete project schedule for the Bughound software using Zoho \\nProjects, including a task set, parallel work breakdown, milestones, task network, critical \\npath, and a final timeline. \\nDevelopment is divided into three major iterations: \\nIteration 1 – Application Foundation \\n• \\nSetting up structure \\n• \\nDesigning GUI \\n• \\nDashboard + navigation \\nIteration 2 – Master Data Management \\n• \\nPrograms, Areas, Employees forms \\n• \\nAdd & update records \\n• \\nData validation \\nIteration 3 – Bug Tracking Module \\n• \\nAdd bug \\n• \\nUpdate bug \\n• \\nSearch bug \\n• \\nBug status, resolution, priority'),\n",
