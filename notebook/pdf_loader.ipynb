An instance of Feedback Arc Set (FAS) is a directed graph G = (V, E) and a natural number\\nk ≥ 0. The problem is to decide if there is a set S of k vertices of G for which, when removing\\nthe vertices of S from G (and all edges incident with them) the resulting graph is acyclic. To\\nsee that FAS is an NP problem we define a certificate for instance ( G, k) to be a set S ⊆ V of\\nk vertices.

For example, adding or removing digit x has a cost equal to x, while changing digit x\\nto digit y incurs a cost equal to |x − y|.

Introduction  \\nBughound is a web-based bug tracking system designed to record, update, search, and \\nmanage bug reports across software projects. It also manages related data including \\nPrograms, Employees, and Functional Areas. The application enables users to create new \\nbugs, update existing bugs, search bug records, and maintain database tables. \\nThis report provides a complete project schedule for the Bughound software using Zoho \\nProjects, including a task set, parallel work breakdown, milestones, task network, critical \\npath, and a final timeline. \\nDevelopment is divided into three major iterations: \\nIteration 1 – Application Foundation \\n• Setting up structure \\n• Designing GUI \\n• Dashboard + navigation \\nIteration 2 – Master Data Management \\n• Programs, Areas, Employees forms \\n• Add & update records \\n• Data validation \\nIteration 3 – Bug Tracking Module \\n• Add bug \\n• Update bug \\n• Search bug \\n• Bug status, resolution, priority'),\n",
